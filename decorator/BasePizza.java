So when I joined, I was part of Pathfinders team, so I had learnt about FDX and TPCS both and once I got hands on,

  I Implemented handling of TANs as part of consent modernization
  Performance testing for VDBS service, after JAVA version upgarde
  Performane testing for consent status job after migration
  Then I mostly worked on Daily job to retry failed VAN updates, preparation of test cases, QA validations, Performnace testing with Dual Write, Reporting
  Also I worked on Photon upgrade for VDBS service
  
Now I'm part of Trailblazers team, so here i have worked on following items:

	I did photon upgrade for consent-db-migration service
	Production deployment after poton upgrade for PDR service and consent-db-migration service
	Got KT on app onboarding services, which was really helpful to understand the entire flow
	Did PVT testing for CAOE service and was validated in perf
	Deployment for CAOE for new pools addition, and have done prod deployment multiple times and got proper hands on
	Have worked on consent-db-migration which is our liquibase repo for craeting PBB tables, also loading data to those tables through liquibase, as part of this, i also wrote a script which will take excel files as input and converts it to sql queries, so that next time data can be loaded with minimal efforts.
	Integrated AEM new endpoints with our CCAR service for target state
	Did PDR migration and then ran PDR RECON jobs in perf environment and analyzed teh mistamches
