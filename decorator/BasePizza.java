So when I joined, I was part of Pathfinders team, so I had learnt about FDX and TPCS both and once I got hands on,

  I Implemented handling of TANs as part of consent modernization
  Performance testing for VDBS service, after JAVA version upgarde
  Performane testing for consent status job after migration
  Then I mostly worked on Daily job to retry failed VAN updates, preparation of test cases, QA validations, Performnace testing with Dual Write, Reporting
  Also I worked on Photon upgrade for VDBS service
  
Now I'm part of Trailblazers team, so here i have worked on following items:

	I did photon upgrade for consent-db-migration service
	Production deployment after poton upgrade for PDR service and consent-db-migration service
	Got KT on app onboarding services, which was really helpful to understand the entire flow
	Did PVT testing for CAOE service and was validated in perf
	Deployment for CAOE for new pools addition, and have done prod deployment multiple times and got proper hands on
	Have worked on consent-db-migration which is our liquibase repo for craeting PBB tables, also loading data to those tables through liquibase, as part of this, i also wrote a script which will take excel files as input and converts it to sql queries, so that next time data can be loaded with minimal efforts.
	Integrated AEM new endpoints with our CCAR service for target state
	Did PDR migration and then ran PDR RECON jobs in perf environment and analyzed teh mistamches
	Will do PDR recon in PROD as well
	Also got a chance to shadow Production support, and got KT for that, so that i can next time handle it on my own
	
	Took AWS developer assocoiate tarining and will take the exam 




	When I joined the Pathfinders team, I quickly gained experience in both FDX and TPCS. After getting hands-on, I began implementing critical processes:

I implemented handling of TANs as part of our consent modernization efforts.
Conducted performance testing for the VDBS service following a JAVA version upgrade, ensuring the service’s responsiveness and stability post-upgrade.
Executed performance testing for the consent status job after migration to validate functionality and optimize job performance.
Worked extensively on the daily job responsible for retrying failed VAN updates, including preparation of test cases, conducting QA validations, Dual Write performance testing, and creating reports for better visibility.
Additionally, I was responsible for executing a Photon upgrade for the VDBS service, contributing to the system’s enhanced performance.
After moving to the Trailblazers team, my responsibilities expanded to a range of projects, each broadening my experience:

I led the Photon upgrade for the consent-db-migration service to improve data consistency and streamline data migrations.
Managed production deployments post-Photon upgrade for both the PDR and consent-db-migration services, ensuring smooth rollout and stability.
Received knowledge transfer (KT) on app onboarding services, which provided a comprehensive understanding of the full application flow, proving valuable for project work.
Performed PVT testing for the CAOE service, validating it in the performance environment to ensure readiness for production.
Led CAOE deployments for new pool additions, conducting several production deployments which gave me hands-on experience with production handling.
Developed expertise with consent-db-migration, our Liquibase repository, to create PBB tables and wrote a script to efficiently load data into these tables. This script allows input from Excel files and converts them into SQL queries, simplifying future data loading tasks.
Integrated new AEM endpoints with our CCAR service as part of target state improvements.
Conducted a PDR migration and ran PDR reconciliation jobs in the performance environment, analyzing mismatches and preparing to do the same in production.
Gained exposure to production support by shadowing the support team and completing KT sessions, preparing me to manage support responsibilities independently.
For my professional development, I completed AWS Developer Associate training and am preparing to take the certification exam.
