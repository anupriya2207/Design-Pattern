So when I joined, I was part of Pathfinders team, so I had learnt about FDX and TPCS both and once I got hands on,

  I Implemented handling of TANs as part of consent modernization
  Performance testing for VDBS service, after JAVA version upgarde
  Performane testing for consent status job after migration
  Then I mostly worked on Daily job to retry failed VAN updates, preparation of test cases, QA validations, Performnace testing with Dual Write, Reporting
  Also I worked on Photon upgrade for VDBS service
  
Now I'm part of Trailblazers team, so here i have worked on following items:

	I did photon upgrade for consent-db-migration service
	Production deployment after poton upgrade for PDR service and consent-db-migration service
	Got KT on app onboarding services, which was really helpful to understand the entire flow
	Did PVT testing for CAOE service and was validated in perf
	Deployment for CAOE for new pools addition, and have done prod deployment multiple times and got proper hands on
	Have worked on consent-db-migration which is our liquibase repo for craeting PBB tables, also loading data to those tables through liquibase, as part of this, i also wrote a script which will take excel files as input and converts it to sql queries, so that next time data can be loaded with minimal efforts.
	Integrated AEM new endpoints with our CCAR service for target state
	Did PDR migration and then ran PDR RECON jobs in perf environment and analyzed teh mistamches
	Will do PDR recon in PROD as well
	Also got a chance to shadow Production support, and got KT for that, so that i can next time handle it on my own
	
	Took AWS developer assocoiate tarining and will take the exam 




	Upon joining the Pathfinders team, I quickly gained proficiency in FDX and TPCS, which allowed me to contribute effectively to the team. My primary accomplishments included:

Consent Modernization: Implemented TAN handling.
VDBS Service: Conducted performance testing after a JAVA upgrade.
Consent Status Job: Executed performance testing following a migration.
Daily Job Enhancements: Worked on retrying failed VAN updates, preparing test cases, QA validations, performance testing with Dual Write, and reporting.
Photon Upgrade: Led the Photon upgrade for the VDBS service.
In the Trailblazers team, I undertook the following projects:

Photon Upgrades and Deployments: Managed the Photon upgrade and production deployments for the consent-db-migration and PDR services.
Knowledge Transfer (KT): Completed KT on app onboarding services, providing valuable insights into the entire flow.
Performance and Production Testing: Conducted PVT testing for CAOE services and performed multiple production deployments for new pool additions.
Consent-db-migration and Scripting: Enhanced consent-db-migration using our Liquibase repo, created PBB tables, and developed a script to convert Excel files into SQL queries for efficient data loading.
Integration and Migration Work: Integrated AEM endpoints with CCAR for the target state, and conducted PDR migration and RECON analysis in the performance environment.
Production Support: Shadowed production support and received KT, preparing me to handle these tasks independently.
Professional Development: Completed AWS Developer Associate training and am preparing to take the certification exam.
